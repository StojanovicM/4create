This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` to run a local dev server, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Notice
Due to the time constraint and the fact that it was not explicitly asked in the assignment, I didn't go all the way to set up the state manager to work with actions and effects. If you would like me to make it work like that, you can notify me through Jasmina or by email: "stornocrveni@gmail.com"
